# Digital-Apothecary
A plugin for the digital synthesizer VCV Rack platform

Made by Evan JJ Edwards

I have been making modules for a while, but I have recently decided to publish the more refined ones in this plugin

Please email if you have any inquires on this project


## Sage - Harmonic Oscillator

![](https://github.com/evanedwardsgit/Digital-Apothecary/blob/main/res/Panels/Sage.svg)

An oscillator that adds harmonically related sine waves to create a more complex and rich waveform and allows for seperate control of odd and even harmonics. This module supports polyphony.

## Linden - Gates

![](https://github.com/evanedwardsgit/Digital-Apothecary/blob/main/res/Panels/Linden.svg)

A module containing some unconventional analog and digital logic gates. The analog circuit takes in two inputs, and outputs the minimum and maximum values to their individual outputs. The Bernoulli gate routes a gate to an output, according to a probability determined by a CV input. The CNOT gate is a fully reverisible digital logic gate.

## Rue - VCA

![](https://github.com/evanedwardsgit/Digital-Apothecary/blob/main/res/Panels/Rue.svg)

A voltage controlled amplifier that has offset control for control voltage and allows for a variable response curve, from linear to exponential, over both CV and gain. This module supports polyphony.
